Hi, I'm Shinya! I am an incoming PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania in the Mechanical Engineering Department. I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia Univeristy. My research interests are numerical analysis of turbulent flows and computational fluid dynamics of moving boundary-layer flows.

Outside of research, I enjoy working on smaller projects in woodworking, 3D printing and incorporating sustainable practices in my everyday life, which I will be showcasing in this website. 

My friend Rebecca and I have a podcast called "Shinya's Sh!t," which are posted biweekly. Hope you enjoy getting a deep dive into my over stimulated mind!
