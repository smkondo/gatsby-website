Welcome everybody to my personal website! My name is Shinya Kondo, and I'm hoping to use this website to showcase my recent projects, discuss my progress on my PhD and also just to post my opinions on a number of different things. If you have anything you want me to talk about, please contact me by email at smkondo@seas.upenn.edu . Hope you enjoy your time at my website!
