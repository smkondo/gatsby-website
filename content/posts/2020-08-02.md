My PhD program stars in early September. I feel slightly underprepared to begin my research, so I've decided to read a couple journal articles to prepare myself. For the month of August, my goal is to read one scientific journal article per day. Below is the list of articles and a short description of each journal I read throughout the month. 

+ Day 6: Rajat Mittal, Gianluca Iaccarino. 2005. Immersed Boundary Method. *Ann. Rev. Fluid Mech.* 37:239-61
+ Day 7: R. P. Beyer, R. J. Leveque. 1992. Analysis of a One-Dimensional Model for the Immersed Boundary Method. *Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics* 29:332-64 
+ Day 8: M.D. de Tullio, P. De Palma, G. Iaccarino, G. Pascazio, M. Napolitano. 2007. An immersed boundary method for compressible flows using local grid refinement. *Journal of Computational Physics* 225:2098-2117
