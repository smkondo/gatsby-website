Today when I went to go water my plants in my garden, two out of the four green bean stalks were eaten by rabbits. These nasty little poop heads need to eat the clovers in my lawn and not my precious green beans. There also seemed to be a lot of bugs eating the radish leaves, so I guess my garden is a smorgasborg for critters and animals alike.

To stop these critters from eating, I made a garlic repellent that I sprayed on the leaves today. I've also ordered some fences from Menards to keep any animals away from my garden. I hope this does the trick.

In other news, we had our first harvest today! We harvested our humongous cucumber and also some edamame beans as well. Hopefully my radishes will be ready to harvest soon.
